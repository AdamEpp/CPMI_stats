# Liquidity Efficiency Measures and Drivers

To install the package run the following command in R.

```
install.packages("CPMIstats_0.1.2.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```

Alternatively, the package can be installed by using the `install_github` function from the R package `devtools`. The steps for this installation are given in the `CPMI_calls.R` file. This method may make it easier to keep the most up to date version.

`CPMI_calls.R` is an example file with a list of all the functions in the package. For more information on the functions
type `?function_name`.


**Update:** version 0.1.3 requires the time column of the payments data to be converted to a hms class, the command to do this is given in `CPMI_calls.R`.
